# Python Script/file to demonstrate how to read and display a JSON file's data /contents

# Import relevant modules

import json

#open the 'burger_sales' file in read mode and display its contents
with open("../files/burger_sales.json","r") as json_file:
    burger_sales = json.load(json_file)
    # use a for loop to display the sales in the file
    for sale in burger_sales:
        print(f"{sale}")

    json_file.close()

# os.open("../files/burger_sales.json") is also a method that could work but is preferred for low level I/O operations.
# For normal usage the open() function works well to return a file object with read() and write() and more methods
